<h1>hello.</h1>

<p>Here's a mock-up of a landing page that may or may not be expanded upon in the future.</p>
<p>This is more of an experiment in Jekyll from scratch, CSS transitions and animations, and some minor, minorss dabblings into JS and jQuery. There's not much here other than the sidebar menu, and there are some artifacts from experiments that I opted to keep here.</p>

<p>Website made using Jekyll (and some love).</p>
